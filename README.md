# Command-Car-using-GYRO-STM32F407
The project aims to create a car control system that relies on a gyroscope for motion detection and an STM32F4 microcontroller for data processing and car actions control. Two HC05 Bluetooth modules are integrated to enable reliable wireless communication between the car and the microcontroller, providing a responsive remote driving experience.
